heg_retaliation,SHIP,"The Retaliation-class Battleship stands as a rare and distinctive modification of the Domain's Retribution-class design. Like its more common counterpart, the Retaliation-class was never widely employed by the Domain, owing to its controversial and aggressive configuration. It emphasizes overwhelming firepower and tactical dominance at the expense of versatility and crew comfort. This formidable weaponry is complemented by significant enhancements to the ship's armor, making it a resilient and deadly presence on the battlefield. However, these upgrades come at a cost. To accommodate the increased weight and power demands of the composite weapon and reinforced armor, all smaller missile and most of its small ballistic systems had to be removed, leaving the Retaliation-class solely reliant on its large weapons.

An ancient but unvenerated class, the Retribution is an extreme battlecruiser design which dates to the renaissance of military experimentation during the first consolidation period of the Domain. It sacrifices armor for firepower and tremendous speed for its size class via a nearly unique implementation of ""Orion Drive"" technology which was considered an archaic curiosity even then.

The physical stress inflicted upon both human flesh and ship components by the propulsive jolts made the Retribution an unpopular ship in the Domain Armada, one of only a handful of opinions shared whole-heartedly by crew and officers alike. Only a handful of examples were ever deployed by the Armada proper, the Retribution finding more use among frontier mercenaries and pirate-hunters that relied upon unexpected bursts of speed and hyper-aggressive tactics.",,,,
